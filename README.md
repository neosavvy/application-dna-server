# Application DNA 

This project is a quick start to get the basics of our Application DNA up and running 
for your project or engagement. 

We use the following basic python frameworks to accomplish our server side applications:

1. FastAPI - provides us a simple RESTful interface with Docs via Swagger and Redocs
2. Celery + Flower + RabbitMQ - provides us a easy to use interface for Queuing and Asynchronous workloads without dependency on any cloud framework. 
3. Supabase - provides us a self-hostable or SaaS interface to a data storage layer that also has support for Authentication, File Storage, and Realtime push capabilities.
